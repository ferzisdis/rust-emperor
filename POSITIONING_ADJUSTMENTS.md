# Kingdom Visual Positioning Adjustments

## Problem Identified

All buildings were positioned at the bottom of the landscape canvas, creating a cramped and unbalanced appearance. The upscaled images (larger than originals) weren't properly accounted for in the initial positioning.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Increased Canvas Height
- **Before**: 400px
- **After**: 450px
- **Reason**: Provides more vertical space for layered building placement

### 2. Adjusted Background Gradient
- **Before**: Sky 40%, Ground 60%
- **After**: Sky 35%, Ground 65%
- **Reason**: More ground space for building placement

### 3. Castle Repositioning

#### Main Castle Structures
```css
/* Before */
.castle-main {
    bottom: 80px;
    width: 80px;
}

/* After */
.castle-main {
    bottom: 180px;  /* +100px higher */
    width: 70px;    /* Slightly smaller for better proportion */
}
```

All castle elements moved 75-100px higher to dominate the upper-middle area.

### 4. Farm Positioning (Left Side)

Created a **layered depth effect** with 6 distinct positions:

| Farm # | Bottom Position | Left Offset | Visual Layer |
|--------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Farm 1 | 165px | -95px | Upper front |
| Farm 2 | 135px | -130px | Middle tier |
| Farm 3 | 200px | -140px | Back tier (higher = further) |
| Farm 4 | 100px | -160px | Lower tier |
| Farm 5 | 70px | -100px | Foreground |
| Farm 6 | 70px | -60px | Foreground near castle |

**Key Changes:**
- Spread across 130px vertical range (70-200px)
- Horizontal spread from -60px to -160px from center
- Creates depth perception through positioning

### 5. Market Positioning (Right Side)

Mirror layout of farms on the right side:

| Market # | Bottom Position | Left Offset | Visual Layer |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Market 1 | 165px | +95px | Upper front |
| Market 2 | 135px | +130px | Middle tier |
| Market 3 | 200px | +140px | Back tier |
| Market 4 | 100px | +160px | Lower tier |
| Market 5 | 70px | +100px | Foreground |
| Market 6 | 70px | +60px | Foreground near castle |

**Symmetrical design** creates visual balance.

### 6. Mines and Smithies (Foreground)

Positioned in the **bottom foreground** to appear closest to viewer:

```css
/* Mines - Bottom left */
.mine-1 { bottom: 30px; left: calc(50% - 170px); }
.mine-2 { bottom: 25px; left: calc(50% - 120px); }
.mine-3 { bottom: 35px; left: calc(50% - 200px); }

/* Smithies - Bottom right */
.smithy-1 { bottom: 30px; left: calc(50% + 170px); }
.smithy-2 { bottom: 25px; left: calc(50% + 120px); }
.smithy-3 { bottom: 35px; left: calc(50% + 200px); }
```

**Key Changes:**
- Moved from 5-10px to 25-35px (more space from edge)
- Spread wider horizontally (-200px to +200px)
- Creates foreground depth

### 7. Z-Index Layering Strategy

Proper depth ordering ensures buildings overlap correctly:

```
Layer System:
├─ z-index: 1     → Background land
├─ z-index: 9-10  → Mines/Smithies (foreground)
├─ z-index: 11-14 → Back tier farms/markets
├─ z-index: 15-16 → Front tier farms/markets
└─ z-index: 18-22 → Castle structures (dominant)
```

### 8. Responsive Adjustments

Each breakpoint maintains the **layered depth effect** while scaling appropriately:

#### Tablet (768px)
- Canvas height: 380px
- Castle: 60px, bottom: 160px
- Buildings: 40px
- Proportional position adjustments

#### Mobile (480px)
- Canvas height: 320px
- Castle: 50px, bottom: 140px
- Buildings: 36-38px
- Tighter horizontal spacing

#### Small Mobile (360px)
- Canvas height: 280px
- Castle: 45px, bottom: 120px
- Buildings: 32-34px
- Minimal but functional layout

## Visual Result

### Before
```

│              │
├──────────────┤ Ground

### After

```

## Technical Details

### Positioning Formula
```css
/* Center-based calculation */
left: calc(50% ± offset_pixels);

/* Examples */
left: calc(50% - 95px);  /* 95px left of center */
left: calc(50% + 140px); /* 140px right of center */
```

### Depth Simulation
Higher `bottom` value = Further back in scene
- 200px = Back layer (appears smaller/distant)
- 165px = Upper tier
- 135px = Middle tier
- 100px = Lower tier
- 70px = Foreground
- 25-35px = Very close foreground

### Size Adjustments
Based on actual image dimensions:
- Castle main: 44x36px → scaled to 70px width
- Castle towers: 32x60px → scaled to 50px width
- Buildings: 40x36px → scaled to 45-50px width
- Land: 384x256px → scaled to 90% canvas width

## Testing Checklist

✅ Castle appears elevated in upper-middle area
✅ Farms spread across left side at multiple depths
✅ Markets spread across right side (mirrored)
✅ Mines and smithies visible in bottom foreground
✅ No building overlap (proper z-index)
✅ Responsive on mobile devices
✅ Maintains aspect ratios of pixel art
✅ Buildings appear/disappear at correct thresholds

- **Depth Perception**: Layered positioning creates 3D effect
- **Readability**: Clear separation between building types
- **Aesthetics**: Matches the grand scale of a growing kingdom
