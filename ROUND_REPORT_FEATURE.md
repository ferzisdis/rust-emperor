# Round Report Feature

## Overview
After each round, players now see a detailed report showing how their resources and popularity changed during that round, just like in the original Java ME version.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Fields in GameState (`src/game/state.rs`)
- `last_event_title: Option<String>` - Stores the title of the last random event
- `last_event_description: Option<String>` - Stores the description of the last random event
- Enhanced `harvest_percent` calculation to show harvest efficiency

### 2. New Template (`templates/report.html`)
A visually appealing report page that displays:
- **Income & Production**
  - Taxes collected from citizens
  - Market income from marketplaces
  - Harvest results with percentage efficiency
- **Popularity Changes**
  - Current popularity percentage
  - Change from previous round (color-coded: green for positive, red for negative)
- **Random Events** (if one occurred)
  - Event title and description in a highlighted section

### 3. Updated Game Routes (`src/routes/game.rs`)
Added three new components:

#### New Routes
- `GET /game/report` - Displays the round report
- `POST /game/continue-from-report` - Returns to main game view after viewing report

#### Modified Routes
- `POST /game/finish-round` - Now redirects to `/game/report` instead of `/game`

#### Enhanced Logic
- Stores `previous_popularity_percent` before applying round effects
- Generates random events with ~30% probability
- Calculates harvest percentage for display
- Properly stores event data for report display

## How It Works

### Flow
1. Player clicks "Finish Round" button
2. System applies all round effects (taxes, harvest, population changes, etc.)
3. System randomly generates an event (30% chance)
4. System stores report data (taxes_value, market_place_value, harvest_value, etc.)
5. **Player is redirected to /game/report** ‚Üê NEW!
6. Report shows all changes from that round
7. Player clicks "Continue" button
8. System clears event data and returns to main game view

### Original Java Implementation Reference
In the original `GameCanvas.java`, the `OpenReportForm()` method was called at line 682 after finishing a round. It displayed:
- Taxes value
- Market income
- Harvest value and percentage
- Popularity change

The new Rust implementation faithfully recreates this functionality with modern web styling.

## Visual Design
- Color-coded values (green for positive, red for negative)
- Medieval-themed styling matching the rest of the game
- Clear sections for different types of information
- Responsive layout
- Event section highlighted with amber colors when present

## Testing
To test the report feature:
1. Start a new game
2. Make some adjustments (set taxes, food supply, build buildings)
3. Click "Finish Round"
4. You should see the round report with all changes
5. Click "Continue" to return to the main game

## Future Enhancements
- Add animation/transition effects when showing the report
- Store report history for review of past rounds
- Add more detailed breakdowns (e.g., population growth factors)
- Export reports to PDF or save them
- Compare current round to previous rounds with charts
