# Testing Guide: Round Report Feature

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd rust-emperor
cargo run
```

The server should start at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Create a New Game
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "New Game"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: TestPlayer
   - Gender: Male or Female
   - Difficulty: Medium
4. Click "Start Game"

### 3. Test Basic Round Report
1. On the main game screen, click **"Finish Round"** without making any changes
2. You should be redirected to `/game/report`
3. Verify the report shows:
   - âœ… "Round Report - Year 1440" title
   - âœ… Taxes Collected: Shows a value (e.g., +3000 ðŸ’°)
   - âœ… Market Income: Shows a value (e.g., +0 ðŸ’°)
   - âœ… Harvest: Shows harvest amount and percentage (e.g., +500 ðŸŒ¾ (100%))
   - âœ… Current Popularity: Shows percentage (e.g., 50%)
   - âœ… Popularity Change: Shows change from previous round
4. Click **"Continue"** button
5. You should return to `/game` (main game view)
6. Verify year changed from 1440 to 1441

### 4. Test with Tax Changes
1. Change "Taxes Level" to "High" (level 4 or 5)
2. Click "Finish Round"
3. On the report:
   - âœ… Taxes Collected should be HIGHER than before
   - âœ… Popularity Change should be NEGATIVE (red text with minus sign)
4. Click "Continue"

### 5. Test with Building Construction
1. Build a Farm (if you have enough gold)
2. Click "Finish Round"
3. On the report:
   - âœ… Harvest value should be HIGHER than previous round
   - âœ… Harvest percentage should show correctly
4. Click "Continue"

### 6. Test Random Events
Since events have a 30% chance, you may need to finish multiple rounds:
1. Click "Finish Round" several times
2. Eventually, you should see an **Event section** on the report with:
   - âœ… Event title (e.g., "âš¡ Event: Good Harvest")
   - âœ… Event description in amber-colored box
   - âœ… Event effects should be visible in the statistics
3. Click "Continue"
4. On next round report, event section should NOT appear (it's cleared)

### 7. Test Report Calculations
Set specific values and verify calculations:

**Test Case A: High Taxes**
- Set Taxes to level 5 (Oppressive)
- Citizens: 1000
- Expected taxes: ~8000 gold
- Expected popularity: Should decrease

**Test Case B: Multiple Farms**
- Build 3 farms
- Expected harvest: ~1500 (3 farms Ã— 500)
- Harvest percentage: ~100% with normal food supply

**Test Case C: Build Markets**
- Build 2 markets
- Expected market income: 100 gold (2 Ã— 50)

## What to Check

### Visual Elements
- [ ] Report page has medieval styling matching the game
- [ ] Positive values are shown in GREEN
- [ ] Negative values are shown in RED
- [ ] Event section (when present) has AMBER/YELLOW background
- [ ] All sections are clearly separated
- [ ] "Continue" button is prominent and centered

### Functionality
- [ ] Report appears AFTER every "Finish Round" action
- [ ] Report shows correct values for taxes, market, harvest
- [ ] Popularity change calculation is correct
- [ ] Random events appear occasionally (~30% of the time)
- [ ] Event data is cleared after viewing report
- [ ] Clicking "Continue" returns to game view
- [ ] Year counter increments correctly
- [ ] Round counter increments correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Report works when gold is 0
- [ ] Report works when popularity is very low
- [ ] Report works when harvest is negative (due to low food supply)
- [ ] Report works when no buildings are constructed
- [ ] Report handles very large numbers properly

## Expected Values Reference

### Taxes (per citizen)
- Level 0 (None): 0 gold
- Level 1 (Low): 1 gold
- Level 2 (Fair): 2 gold
- Level 3 (Normal): 3 gold
- Level 4 (High): 5 gold
- Level 5 (Oppressive): 8 gold

### Market Income
- Per market: 50 gold

### Harvest
- Per farm: 500 food (base)
- Food supply bonus:
  - Level 0: -200
  - Level 1: -100
  - Level 2: 0
  - Level 3: +100
  - Level 4: +200
  - Level 5: +300

### Popularity Changes
- Tax penalty ranges from +2 (no taxes) to -5 (oppressive)
- Food supply penalty ranges from -10 (none) to +2 (generous)

## Comparison with Original

The new implementation matches the original Java ME version:
- Shows taxes, market income, harvest with percentage
- Shows popularity and its change
- Displays random events
- Uses a modal/separate screen (now a web page)
- Requires user to acknowledge before continuing

## Troubleshooting

### Report doesn't show
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify server is running and no Rust errors
- Check that `/game/report` route is registered
- Verify game state is not null

### Values seem wrong
- Check that round effects are being applied in `apply_round_effects()`
- Verify calculations match expected formulas
- Check that `previous_popularity_percent` is being stored before changes

### Events never appear
- Events have 30% chance, may need 5-10 rounds to see one
- Check that `EventGenerator::generate_random_event()` is being called
- Verify event data is being stored in `last_event_title` and `last_event_description`

### Can't continue from report
- Verify `/game/continue-from-report` route is registered
- Check that form POST method is correct
- Verify button is inside the form tags

## Success Criteria
âœ… Report appears after every round  
âœ… All values are calculated correctly  
âœ… Visual styling matches game theme  
âœ… Events appear occasionally  
âœ… Continue button works properly  
âœ… Game state is preserved correctly  

If all checks pass, the Round Report feature is working correctly!
